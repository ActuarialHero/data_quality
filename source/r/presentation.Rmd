## Overview

We'll talk through ways to quickly and easily evaluate data quality before actuarial analyses begin.

Data sets are entirely fictional but represent real-world problems I have encountered in my actuarial career.

## Slide with Bullets

- Ratemaking
- Modeling
- Reserving

## Slide with R Output

```{r packages}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(summarytools)
```

## Read in insurance data sets
> read_csv("./data_in/blah.csv")

## Replace this with insurance data
```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Using dfSummary
```{r cars dfSummary, echo = TRUE}
dfSummary(cars)
```

## Frequency tables

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
